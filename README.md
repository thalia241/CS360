Overview

This repository contains the completed App Code Design artifact submitted for the course portfolio requirement. The ZIP file includes the finalized mobile application source code developed in Project Three, along with the finalized UI design originally created in Project Two and used as the foundation for implementation. Together, these materials demonstrate the full mobile app design and development lifecycle, from planning and user-centered design to functional code implementation and testing.

App Requirements and Goals

The goal of this application was to design and develop a simple, functional mobile app that supports core user needs through an intuitive interface. The app was designed to allow users to input, view, and manage weight-related information in a clear and accessible way. Key requirements included usability, clarity of navigation, and reliable data handling. The app focuses on reducing friction for the user by keeping interactions straightforward and minimizing unnecessary complexity.

User Needs and UI Design

To support user needs, the app includes clearly defined screens with focused functionality. Each screen serves a specific purpose and follows consistent layout and visual patterns to reduce cognitive load. UI elements such as buttons, text fields, and labels were designed with accessibility and ease of use in mind. The interface prioritizes readability, logical flow, and predictable behavior, which helps users quickly understand how to interact with the app. The UI design was successful because it remained centered on the user’s perspective rather than technical complexity.

Coding Approach and Development Strategy

The app was developed using a structured and incremental coding approach. Features were implemented one at a time, with frequent testing to ensure stability before moving forward. Code was organized to separate concerns, making it easier to read, maintain, and debug. Reusable components and clear naming conventions were used to improve clarity and long-term maintainability. This approach helped prevent cascading errors and made development more manageable.

These strategies are directly applicable to future projects, particularly larger applications where modular design, clean structure, and incremental testing are essential for scalability and collaboration.

Testing and Validation

Testing was performed throughout development using both emulator testing and manual interaction testing. Each feature was tested to confirm expected behavior and to identify UI or logic issues early. This process is critical because it ensures that the application functions reliably from the user’s perspective and reduces the likelihood of failures after deployment. Testing also helped reveal edge cases that informed small but important design and logic improvements.

Design and Development Challenges

One of the primary challenges was translating the UI design from the planning stage into a fully functional implementation while maintaining usability. This required adapting layouts and logic to align with platform constraints and user interaction patterns. Innovation was required to balance simplicity with functionality, particularly when refining navigation flow and screen transitions.

Areas of Strength

The strongest component of this project was the successful integration of user-centered design principles with functional application logic. The final product demonstrates a solid understanding of mobile UI design, basic app architecture, and iterative development practices. The app reflects practical skills in planning, implementation, and refinement, making it a strong portfolio artifact that represents both technical ability and design awareness.
